# Reverse Engineering

## Introduction

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a system to understand its internal structure and operation. It is used to find software vulnerabilities, add new features, or improve existing features.

Reverse engineering is used in a variety of fields, including:

* Security: Analysis of malware, vulnerability analysis
* System development: Analysis of existing software for reuse or feature addition
* Embedded system development: Analysis and development of firmware
* Hardware development: Analysis of hardware for understanding its features and operation

My goals in reverse engineering are to:

* Strengthen my skills as a security professional
* Learn new technologies and apply them in practice
* Contribute to the reverse engineering community

## Content

The repository currently contains the following content:

* Write-ups of challenges from reversing.kr
    * reversing.kr is a Korean reverse engineering website. I am improving my reverse engineering skills by solving various difficulty levels of problems provided by this website.
* Analysis of malware samples
    * Malware uses a variety of techniques to infiltrate a victim's system, steal information, or damage the system. I am researching how to understand these techniques and defend against them by analyzing malware.
* Reverse engineering of firmware
    * Firmware is software that controls the operation of hardware. By analyzing firmware, I can understand the features and operation of hardware and add new features or improve existing features using it.
* Reverse engineering of hardware
    * Hardware consists of mechanical components and software. By analyzing hardware, I can understand the mechanical structure and operation and design or improve new hardware using it.

## Future plans

In the future, I will:

* Improve my reverse engineering skills by solving more challenging problems.
* Research new attack techniques by analyzing malware and develop ways to defend against them.
* Conduct projects to add new features or improve existing features by analyzing firmware and hardware.
